title: Hierarchical phrase-based translation
---
*Hierarchical phrase-based translation* is a translation model type based on [SCFGs](/concepts/scfgs.html) that models translation as phrase pairs that can contain gaps. The translation rules are extracted from parallel aligned sentences without any tree annotations.

Hierarchical phrase-based translation systems are often referred to as **Hiero** systems.
